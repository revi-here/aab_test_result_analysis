# aab_test_result_analysis

Investigate the user behavior for a company's app that sells food products.
The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, for which they decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.   

The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Find out which set of fonts produces better results.
Creating two A groups has certain advantages. We can make it a principle that we will only be confident in the accuracy of our testing when the two control groups are similar. If there are significant differences between the A groups, this can help us uncover factors that may be distorting the results. Comparing control groups also tells us how much time and data we'll need when running further tests.
